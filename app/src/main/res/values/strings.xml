    <string name="instruction1">In this game you play a board of
        TicTacToe where each square in the board is an entire game of TicTacToe.
        Your goal is to win the small games in order to win a square and then win the big TicTacToe board!</string>
    <string name="instruction2">At the beginning of the game the first player will be prompted
        to choose the board they want to play on.
        After that, players will take turns to place their square. However, there is a special rule!</string>
    <string name="instruction3">If you place a square, then the next board to be played on must
        be in the same position as the square! For example,
        here X places their mark on the top-left square so the next board to be played on in the top-left board.</string>
    <string name="instruction4">Another rule is that if the next board to
        be played is already taken then the next player can choose any board they want.
        Here the middle-right board is already taken so X can now choose any board they like to play on.</string>
    <string name="instruction5">Once the outer board is won like in this example the it is game over.</string>
    <string name="instruction6">That is it! enjoy playing.</string>
